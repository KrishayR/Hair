# Hair
"Hair" is a GUI application where you can experiment with different hair styles real time. It is made using open-cv and tkinter. 

# Usage
To use this GUI, start by running `GUI.py`. You will see a starting screen that looks like this:

The first button represents a fade, the mushroom icon indicates a mushroom cut, "bang" is for bangs, the 4th icon is an anime hair style, and the afro icon will give you an afro.
